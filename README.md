# DSLM-peer-review

Instructions for the DSLsofMath course peer review of exercise solutions.

## Background

Based on feedback from the student representatives in the [DSLsofMath course](https://github.com/DSLsofMath/DSLsofMath), we have decided to set up a peer-review system for solutions to exercises.

The peer review is not a compulsory part of the course, but it is recommended to help your learning process.

## Instructions

When I write "participant" below it refers to those students who choose to take part in the peer-review activity.

* Each participant creates a repository using the GitHub classroom link distributed on the course mailing list.
* Pick at least one exercise per week (=chapter) from the lecture notes.
* Commit each solution to a file like "01/E1.9.lhs", "02/E2.1.lhs", "03/E3.3.hs", etc.
* When you want feedback (say, once a week), create an issue with the title "Week 1" (or similar) indicating the file(s) you want review and assign Patrik or Daniel from the teaching team.
* The teaching team will then add a peer to your repository, and reassign the issue to the peer.
* Similarly, you will most likely be asked to peer-review some other student's exercise solution.
* Please complete the review within 3 working days.

Once you have established a peer connection, you may interact freely
on other exercises or course parts, but not on the Assignments which
are parts of your course examination.

The grading of the compulsory assignments are still handled using
Fire. Do not use the peer-review repository for those assignments, to
avoid accidental sharing of code between "lab-groups".

## How to peer review

The format for the peer review is free, but the aim to to help your peer to find bugs, improve the solution, and in general understand the problem better.

You can comment directly in the code / solution and add test cases to show what you did to convince yourself of the correctness of the solution (or to find bugs, if any).

This whole peer-review exercise is aimed at the learning outcome "discuss and compare different software implementations of mathematical concepts".
